Steps to set up Oracle DB on MacOS

Note: Oracle database is not supported on MacOs as Windows and other OSs. We can use Oracle VM(on virtual box) as a database.

To install Oracle database we need
1.	Virtual Box
Download link
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (Click on OS X hosts)

Error 
If Installation error occurs 
First thing to check is whether MacOS blocked the loading process.

Go to- Apple logo on left side->System & preferences->Security & Privacy->General.
If blocked-> unlock and click on ‘Allow’ button.
(This button will be shown for only 30 mins after downloading. If not visible-reinstall to allow)

2.	Download “Oracle Developer VM”
Download link-
https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/databaseappdev-vm.html

3.	Java
As per the requirements given in the SQL Developer website, JDK 8 or 11 is required.
But for MacOS it was not working.

Install JAVA 17(macOS x64 DMG Installer)
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-mac

Change the JDK version  8/11 from sqldeveloper.sh file to JAVA 17
Go to-
Applications->SQL Developer->show package contents->MacOS->sqldeveloper.sh

4.	SQL Developer

             To create connection:
              Enter these details for your connection:
●	Name: whatever you like. A name such as “VirtualBox Oracle” is OK if you can’t think of anything.
●	Username: hr
●	Password: oracle
●	Check Save Password if you don’t want to enter the password every time.
●	Hostname: localhost
●	Port: 1521
●	Select “Service Name” instead of “SID”
●	Service Name: orcl
●	Connection Type: Basic

Errors

mongosh not found
Resolved by using mongo instead of mongosh. Apparently image uses mongo but the default connection command uses mongosh.

Mongoexport command not found
If mongoexport is in the same directory that your current one (and also is executable and you got perms to execute it) then you need to prepend executable with ./ and invoke it that way.
